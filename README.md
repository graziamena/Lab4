# Project Overview

-In this project, we aimed to enhance a basic HTML structure for responsiveness using CSS techniques.

-The project emphasized the importance of responsive web design in modern web development, ensuring usability across diverse screen sizes.

-Our objectives encompassed achieving seamless layout adjustments for desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

-Through a series of different lab exercises, we explored different methodologies for achieving responsiveness, including media queries and Flexbox.

-Exercise B focused on implementing media queries without using Flex, emphasizing fluid image resizing, menu styling, and content gap management.

-Exercise C introduced Flexbox as the primary technique for responsive layout adjustments, incorporating media queries for distinct screen sizes.

-The project underscored the significance of adapting web content to varying screen sizes for improved user experience and accessibility.
